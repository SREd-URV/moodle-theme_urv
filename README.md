# Moodle Theme for the Universitat Rovira i Virgili

This is the Theme for the Moodle 2.8 for Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV).

It is based on the core theme More, inheriting all the interesting
properties.

The main differences are as follows:

1. It allows for placing blocks in the central column when you set up the 3-column layout.
2. It allows to customize logos per course category, within the same theme.

# Customized logos per category

To do so, go to the theme settings follow the instructions. You need a main logo, a base logo
where some text will be written onto it and a font type. The text that will be written onto
the base logo, generating a new image file, will be:

1. The category's description, if any. This allows you to customize the text to your needs
   and to fit into the image area. This is very useful, since this description is only seen
   by administrators.
2. The category's name. This is the last resort if there is no description available.

The text will be printed into the area of the base logo. So, the text that will not fit
into the image area will be rejected silently. We recommend you to customize category's
description to have a better play with it.
